function I_rec = my_col2im(X, patch, im_size)

% Provides the functionality of col2im function of the image processing
% toolbox.
%
% INPUT
% X: (d x n) observations matrix. Obviously d=patch*patch and n is the 
%            number of patches extracted
% patch: The size of the square patches extracted
% im_size: Size of the original image 
%
% OUTPUT
% I_rec: image

% It will only work for orthogonal matrices and exact patches coverage
